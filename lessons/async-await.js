/**
 * Our testing framework works great for our synchronous
 * test. What if we had some asynchronous functions that
 * we wanted to test? We could make our callback functions
 * async, and then use the await keyword to wait for that
 * to resolve, then we can make our assertion on the result
 * and the expected.
 *
 * Letâ€™s make our testing framework support promises so
 * users can use async/await.
 *
 * Task: modify `test` and `expect` to handle asynchronous
 * functions.
 *
 * Execute: Use `node lessons/async-await.js` to run the test.
