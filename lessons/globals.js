/**
 * These testing utilities that we built are pretty useful.
 * We want to be able to use them throughout our application
 * in every single one of our test files.
 *
 * Some testing frameworks provide their helpers as global
 * variables. Letâ€™s implement this functionality to make it
 * easier to use our testing framework and assertion library.
 * We can do this by exposing our test and expect functions on
 * the global object available throughout the application.
 *
 * Task: Create global object in "setup-globals.js" so that we can use `test` and
 * `expect` in any file inside the project.
 *
 * Execute: Use `node --require ./setup-globals.js lessons/globals.js` to run the test.
